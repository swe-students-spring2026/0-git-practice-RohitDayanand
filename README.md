### Why I found this interesting

Just edited git config. This article discusses a very real and timely issue in software development: **how AI-generated code — despite looking polished — can quietly introduce serious security vulnerabilities** that developers may trust too readily. As AI-assisted coding becomes more widespread in engineering teams, we are seeing an increase in the percentage of code automatically generated by tools without deep validation. What makes this especially compelling is the concept of the *“illusion of correctness”* — code that appears correct on the surface but hides subtle flaws that can lead to exploitable bugs. The article highlights recent survey data showing a notable uptick in enterprise teams struggling to properly assess AI-generated code and explicitly increasing security tooling around it.

In a world where more teams are adopting AI assistants like Copilot or Claude, the tension between **productivity and correctness** is becoming a central concern. Frankly it’s about the long-term maintainability and safety of the software we build.

This article really highlights a crucial tension in modern software development — AI can accelerate coding, but without careful review, it risks creating a false sense of security. The 'illusion of correctness' is a warning all teams should take seriously.
